        1. Can A simple jab of knife kill a tree? Why not?
        <br><br>
        ans: It takes mich time to kill a
tree, and A single jab of knife is not going to be enough to kill it. This is
because the tree has grown, and consumed the earth, and the tree will grow
again. The tree will grow back through healing the bark by consuming water,
sunlight, air and nutrients from the earth.
<br><br>
2. The tree has slowly grown to its
full size. It absorbed years of sunlight, a lot of water and air. The words are:
Consuming, sprouting, growing, etc- <br><br> 3. "Bleeding bark" means the sap of the tree
oozes out. What makes it bleed is the hacking and choping. <br><br> 4. The poet begins the
3rd stanza by saying "no". This is because he disagrees on the fact that the
tree will not come out. He wants the root to be pulled out, however needed.<br> <br> 5.
The earth was a shelter for the tree. Hence, it is called as "anchoring earth"
or "earth-cave". <br><br> 6. The strength of the tree exposed means that the tree's power,
its roots have been exposed, which means that it is exposed to air, sunlight,
and the open. <br> <br>7. The roots become hard, dark, twisted, and withered, and finally
the tree dies off.
